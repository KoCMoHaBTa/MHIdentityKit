//- parameter redirectionHandler: The handler to be called when a redirection occur for the specified `redirectURI`. The handler takes as argument the redirect `URLRequest` and returns boolean value that indicates whenver the redirect request has been successfully handled. An error is thrown if the redirect request is an [error response](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1.2.1)
//- note: In the context of `AuthorizationCodeGrantFlow` - a redirecting is handled if it matches the [Authorization Response specifications](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1.2). In that case the web browser should be closed after which an access token rquest is issued.
